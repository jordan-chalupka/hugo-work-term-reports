introduction: My name is Jordan Chalupka, and at the time of writing this, I am completing my Undergraduate degree in  Software Engineering at the University
                      of Guelph. For the past 8 months, I have been working at PagerDuty on the Growth team. The purpose of this blog
                      is to document my time at PagerDuty; covering topics such as my goals, projects I was involved with,
                      and skills that I gained through this work experience.
about: For my fourth and fifth work term, I had the pleasure to work for [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/).  In short, PagerDuty is an incident management platform that provides reliable notifications, automatic escalations, on-call scheduling, and other functionality to help teams detect and fix infrastructure problems quickly.

job_description: During my work-term, I was part of the Growth team.  Within this team, I was part of an engineering effort called "Growth Hacking". On this team I was involved with many projects, such as revamping PagerDuty's Onboarding flow, creating a "Propensity to Buy" machine learning model, and building a one-click integration for PagerDuty's Slack app to name a few.  Also, during my days I took part in several scrum ceremonies to point tickets, plan spints, and reflect on past sprints.

  project_list:
    - name: Propensity to Buy.
      description: 
        - One of the projects that I worked on at PagerDuty was a machine learning model for calculating Propensity to Buy.  I began working on this project in it's original brainstorming and model experimentation phase, and was able to productionize it within the scope of my work term.  One of the most interesting parts about working on this project was the involvment it had with other engineering teams at PagerDuty such as Site Reliability Engineering and Machine Learning Platform.

        - Being a part of this project also allowed me to apply many of the concepts I have learned about in my statistics courses towards a real world problem.  Being able to work closely with my team's data scientist allowed me to accomplish my goal of taking on a more data science focused role for the second half of my internship.

    - name: Revamping Onboarding
      description:
        - One of the main parts of the PagerDuty product that I worked on from a UI perspective was PagerDuty's Onboarding experience. My team ideated and launched several A/B experiments inside of the Onboarding experience in order to test ideas on what made the best Onboarding experience.  Through this, we gathered enough information to merrit a re-write of the existing Onboarding experience. For this project, I was one of two techincal leads, which was an amazing experience. I was responsible for creating tickets to break down the work, and all of the upfront planning and investigation for the project. This involved talking to other teams who had experience writing React apps so that we could use a similar approach in this project. In the end we were able to rewrite the existing Onboarding flow in React, launch this new version of onboarding as an A/B experiment against the old version of Onboarding, and conclude that the new version improved several key metrics against the old version.         
    - name: HackDays
      description: 
        - While this was not a specific "Project" I feel the need to write a section dedicated to "HackDays" at PagerDuty.  HackDays are without a doubt one of my favourite memories of my time working at PagerDuty.  Every 3 weeks, HackDays are a day where anyone in the company can use their time to learn something new, or create something useful, and then share what they did with the company.  I participated in every HackDay during my internship, and managed to win 3 of them.  My winning HackDay projects were "HackDuty" a slackbot for pairing people into teams on HackDay, a PagerDuty stock price ticker which notified people using PagerDuty when there was a substantial change in the price of the stock, and an improvement to the way front-end changes can be QA'd using Github.
# This should be broken down into paragraphs ...
learning_goals_and_reflections:
  - My first goal was to volunteer with an organization through pagerduty.org.  Every employee at PagerDuty is given volunteer hours to get involved within the community and make a difference.  I decided to make it a goal to make use of this awesome initiative and volunteer.  The organization that I ended up volunteering with was through a PagerDuty internal movement known as SisterDuty.  SisterDuty aims to help encourage women in STEM.  On my volunteer day I spent an afternoon building robots with underprivileged youth from an afterschool program in Toronto.  I definetely would recommend taking advantage of volunteer hours if you are fortunate enough to be given them!
  - My second goal was to deploy my Propensity to Buy model into production.  This goal builds on work which I had done in my first workterm at PagerDuty, and involved working with Site Reliability and the Machine Learning Platform teams in order to get my machine learning model running in production.  In the end I was able to get this project fully productionized, and I am very proud of what was acoomplished through this goal.
  - Another goal that I set for myself this term was to document the Propensity to Buy project, and to hand the project off to another full time engineer.  Early on in working on the Propensity to Buy project I knew that it would be important to document decisions and techincal details about this project.  Since this was the first machine learning model my team had productionized (and one of the first in PagerDuty!) I knew it would be important to add documentation.  I also knew that since I would not be staying at PagerDuty forever, I would need to pair with another engineer and bring them up to speed on what I had accomplished.  By the end of the term I created a detailed multi page readme document for the project, a techincal one-pager, a powerpoint presentation, and a confluence doc with both the business case for the project as well as the technical details for the project at a high level.  I was also able to pair with another full time engineer to bring them up to speed on the project and put them in a position where the were comfortable owning the project.
lessons_learned:
  description: During my time at PagerDuty, I learned a lot of skills both technical and non-technical.
  lessons_list:
    - One valuable learning experiences I gained through this intership were organization skills, since I had to co-ordinate with multiple people accross different teams in the Propensity to Buy project.  I also realized during the completion of this goal how awesome it is to work with people who are willing to assist accross the organization, and appreciated everyone who helped to make this goal a success.
    - Another valuable skill that I developed was learning to strategically use A/B testing to get more learnings about the effectiveness of changes and new features.  One of the main ideas I will take away from this internship is to have a "Learn fast" mentality when it comes to software engineering, instead of the commonly used "Fail fast" phrase.  Being able to learn quickly when you make a change allows you to avoid making the same mistake twice, and can provide information which is highly valuable to others in the organization.
    - Although there are many more, for the purposes of this work term report the final lesson that I learned this semester was to always have an opinion.  In previous work terms I was given feedback to be more verbally involved in meetings/planning.  I took this feedback constructively and made a concious effort to be more verbal in my opinion and though process.  I feel that because of this change, I was given more responsibility over the decisions that were made on my team.  This lead to me taking on more leadership roles, such as tech lead on the React Onboarding project, as well as on the Propensity to Buy project.
  
conclusion:
  - I would consider my work term at PagerDuty a huge success. I learned a lot, gained valuable experiences, got to work with
                      a great team, and had some fun while doing it. I would like to thank everyone on my team for their support, and a big thank you to everyone at PagerDuty for creating such a great work environment.
