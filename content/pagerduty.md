introduction: Hello!  My name is Jordan Chalupka and I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph.  This blog post is a reflection on my experience as part of PagerDuty's Career Acceleration Program or CAP.  I will talk about my role within the company and my team, as well as learnings I took from this experience and goals that I accomplished.

job_description: CAP is PagerDuty's internship and apprenticeship program. The program includes components such as professional development, networking and lots of fun. The team I worked with during my internship was called the Growth or "Growth Hacking" team.  The Growth team is intensely focused to acquire, grow and retain customers by providing a delightful, reliable, personalized and frictionless user experience.

    - name: Trial Onboarding
      description: 
        - Trial onboarding is the 
        - During this project I gained experience using a front end framework called Ember. The main objectives for this project was to educate new users with the product and to improve our metric collection to allow us to gain insight on the trial experience.

        - After launching the initial experiment, the onboarding experience was then re-written using React. I took on more of a leadership role in this part of the project as part of a two person tech-lead or "love seat" as it is sometimes refered to.  As a tech lead for the project it was my responsibility to reasearch and communicate the value this project would bring, the architectural design of the system, the requirements, and write up tickets with acceptance crieteria to review with the team. 
    - name: Propensity to Buy Model
      description:
        - A propensity to buy model is a mathematical model which outputs the probability of an account converting and becoming a paying customer based on the account's traits and actions. The model that I created used 13 features to predict the probability of a user becoming a buying customer using data collected during the first 5 days of their trial experience.  I was able to learn about and apply modeling techniques such as random forest classification, logistic regression, decision trees, and a ensemble voting models as well as how to analyse these models to determine effectiveness and tradeoffs.
        - <div><img class="center-block img-responsive" src="/img/propensity-to-buy.png" style="width:50%"/></div>
        - To me this was the most exciting project that I worked on because having insight into the factors that influence a user buying will allow engineering, sales, and marketing teams to become more effective and focused.
        - As part of this project I also wrote and assisted in the creation of several peices of documentation to organize this project such as a one-pager introducing the project and it's use cases/goals, requirements and milestones with a timeline, and a slide deck outlining the results and next steps for the project.

conclusion:
  - I’ve found that using experimentation in development is very effective, and it is a mindset that I will continue to embrace in the future.  Early on when I was introduced to how the growth team uses experimentation the main value I found in it was “Fail fast”.  This has changed throughout the term, and I now would say the term “Learn fast” more accurately describes the benefits that come with experimentation.
  - Knowing what I know now there are a couple pieces of advice that I would give to myself
    One is that hackdays are a Lot of fun.  I’ve really enjoyed being able to participate in monthly hackdays and have been lucky enough to win two. I would recommend getting involved as much as possible and just having fun with it.
    I would also make sure to remind myself to take advantage of opportunities to better understand the product and the business.  This can be done by learning about the business model, shadowing an on call to understand how the product is used, and shadowing support for a day to learn more about the problems people are having with them product.
    In ending this presentation I would just like to take the time to thank all of my team members for their support, and Alex for support and involvement this term.  Thank you.
  - Hello!  I’d like to start off by thanking everyone for coming to the presentations.  Thank you to the growth team for an amazing 4 months, and to all the other CAP participants.
